# Stefan's dotfiles

## Installation

Installation is simple. Just copy and paste the following script into your terminal. The script should do the rest. A wizard will walk you through the installation process. If you setup a new machine, you should proably execute all sections (homebrew + code environment + mac settings).

```
git clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

## TODO

Stuff which should be added to the dotfiles:

- [ ] [thyme](https://github.com/sourcegraph/thyme). Installation of binary and aliases to use.
